#Briefly explain four distinct scenarios (differing values of i, j, and k) in which this code would fail to give an accurate and meaningful result. 

#i = 3
#j = 5
#k = 2
#if i > j - k: 
    #print('i is larger than the difference between j and k')
#elif j > i + k: 
   # print('j is larger than the sum of i and k')
#else: 
    #print('k is either the largest or smallest')

Your Answer:
1.  when i =-3  j =-1 and k= 1 i.e , the results wil not be accurate. i is not greater than j-k,  j is not larger than i +k and k is not the smallest or largest


2. if i =-2  and j=5 and k = -9. i is  not greater than j- k because i is -5 is not greater than -5-2 which is -7. it cant print the if statement, k is not the largest k or the ellif or else statement

3. if all the variables are equal, i=5, j=5=k=5, not of the conditions will be met

4. if i= 3, j= 7 and k =4 the conditons will not be met
