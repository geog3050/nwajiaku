#Briefly explain four distinct scenarios (differing values of i, j, and k) in which this code would fail to give an accurate and meaningful result. 

#i = 3
#j = 5
#k = 2
#if i > j - k: 
    #print('i is larger than the difference between j and k')
#elif j > i + k: 
   # print('j is larger than the sum of i and k')
#else: 
    #print('k is either the largest or smallest')

Your Answer:
1.  when i =2  j =4 and k= 2 i.e , the results wil not be accurate. i is not greater than j-k,  j is not larger than i +k and k is either the largest or the smallest is misleading


2. if i =1  and j=2 and k = 2. 1  is  not greater than j- k (0), 2 is not greater than 3. 2 is not the largest or smallest

3. if all the variables are equal, i=5, j=5=k=5, not of the conditions will be met

4. if i= 3, j= 7 and k =4 the conditons will not be met
